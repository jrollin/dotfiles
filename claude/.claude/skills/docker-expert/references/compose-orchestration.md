# Docker Compose Orchestration

## Production-Ready Compose Pattern

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: production
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.25'
          memory: 256M

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB_FILE: /run/secrets/db_name
      POSTGRES_USER_FILE: /run/secrets/db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
    secrets:
      - db_name
      - db_user
      - db_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true

volumes:
  postgres_data:

secrets:
  db_name:
    external: true
  db_user:
    external: true
  db_password:
    external: true
```

## Development Override

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
      - /app/dist
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DEBUG=app:*
    ports:
      - "9229:9229"  # Debug port
    command: npm run dev
```

## Resource Management

```yaml
services:
  app:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
```

## Orchestration Expertise

| Topic | Best Practice |
|-------|---------------|
| Dependencies | Use `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` |
| Networks | Custom networks for service isolation |
| Environment | Separate dev/staging/prod configurations |
| Volumes | Named volumes for persistence, bind mounts for dev |

## Checklist

- [ ] Service dependencies properly defined with health checks
- [ ] Custom networks configured for service isolation
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations separated (dev/prod)
- [ ] Volume strategies appropriate for data persistence needs
- [ ] Resource limits defined to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Restart policies configured for production resilience
- [ ] Port exposure limited to necessary services
- [ ] Service naming follows conventions for discovery
- [ ] Network security implemented (internal networks for backend)
